                <p>My name is Amina Hayat, I am 24 years old and graduated with BA Degree in English and Creative Writing. </p>
                <p>I then went on to getting my PGCE and QTS in teaching English at Secondary School, something which I 
                thoroughly enjoyed! </p>
                <p>I am now working as an English Teacher, but I am an aspiring Software Engineer so I am learning this at the 
                Coding Bootcamp at UoB. </p>
                <p>I enjoy learning how to become a Full Stack Developer. I am hoping to transition into the tech world!</p>
                <p>Aside from this, I enjoy shopping, I <strong>LOVE</strong> 
                I am also a keen Mandala drawer and I also love to spend time with family
                and friends.</p>
